      <h2>Context & Business Need</h2>
    
      <p>
        In integration-heavy environments, multiple external partners interact with the company through APIs.
        Many of the values sent in API requests originate from operational user interfaces and are entered by end users
        during day-to-day work (e.g., booking details, customer data, shipping instructions, customs declaration, ...).
      </p>
    
      <p>
        After submitting a request, users typically receive a report (for example via email) confirming whether the call
        succeeded and listing any validation errors. In many real workflows, those errors are expressed in highly technical
        terms (schema/contract language), which makes them hard to interpret and slows down correction cycles.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This Proof of Concept aims to demonstrate that by integrating an LLM into the validation process,
        technical contract errors can be translated into user-friendly messages and concrete suggestions on how to fix the input,
        reducing friction for end users and improving the overall turnaround time for integrations.

      <h2>Stakeholders & Users</h2>
    
      <p>
        The validation process involves multiple actors across technical and operational domains.
        Understanding their different perspectives is essential to frame the business need correctly.
      </p>
    
      <h3>1. Integration Partners</h3>
      <p>
        External systems interacting with company APIs. They submit structured payloads based on agreed contracts.
        When validation fails, they receive technical feedback that may not always clearly indicate how to correct the request.
      </p>
    
      <h3>2. Operational End Users</h3>
      <p>
        Users entering data in front-end applications (e.g., booking, customer or shipment details).
        The API payload often reflects data previously entered through a UI.
        When validation errors occur, these users may receive reports or notifications
        containing highly technical messages that are difficult to interpret.
      </p>
    
      <h3>3. QA & Support Teams</h3>
      <p>
        Responsible for investigating validation failures and supporting issue resolution.
        They often act as intermediaries between technical validation logic and business users.
        Poorly interpretable errors increase investigation time and ticket volume.
      </p>
    
      <h3>4. Delivery & Product Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>
        Accountable for integration reliability, partner satisfaction, and operational efficiency.
        Validation clarity directly impacts turnaround time and cross-team collaboration.
