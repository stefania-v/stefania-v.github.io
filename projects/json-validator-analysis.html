      <h2>Context & Business Need</h2>
    
      <p>
        In integration-heavy environments, multiple external partners interact with the company through APIs.
        Many of the values sent in API requests originate from operational user interfaces and are entered by end users
        during day-to-day work (e.g., booking details, customer data, shipping instructions, customs declaration, ...).
      </p>
    
      <p>
        After submitting a request, users typically receive a report (for example via email) confirming whether the call
        succeeded and listing any validation errors. In many real workflows, those errors are expressed in highly technical
        terms (schema/contract language), which makes them hard to interpret and slows down correction cycles.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This Proof of Concept aims to demonstrate that by integrating an LLM into the validation process,
        technical contract errors can be translated into user-friendly messages and concrete suggestions on how to fix the input,
        reducing friction for end users and improving the overall turnaround time for integrations.

      <h2>Stakeholders & Users</h2>
    
      <p>
        The validation process impacts different actors across technical and operational domains:
      </p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Integration Partners:</strong> External systems calling company APIs. 
        When validation fails, they receive technical error messages that may not clearly indicate how to correct the request.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Operational End Users:</strong> Users entering data through front-end applications 
        (e.g., booking or customer details). API payloads often reflect data previously entered in a UI. 
        Technical validation errors returned via reports or emails can be difficult to interpret and act upon.</li>
    
        <li><strong>QA & Support Teams:</strong> Responsible for investigating validation failures and assisting in issue resolution. 
        Poorly interpretable errors increase analysis time and ticket volume.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Delivery & Product Stakeholders:</strong> Accountable for integration reliability and partner satisfaction. 
        Clear validation feedback directly impacts turnaround time and cross-team efficiency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>High-Level Flow</h2>
    
      <p>
        The POC fits into a standard API validation workflow. The deterministic validation remains the source of truth
        (JSON Schema). The AI layer is used only to translate technical issues into user-friendly, actionable messages.
      </p>
    
      <ol>
        <li><strong>API request submitted</strong> by a partner system (values often originate from a user-facing UI).</li>
        <li><strong>Deterministic validation</strong> checks the payload against the JSON Schema contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Structured validation report</strong> is produced (technical issues, invalid values, expected constraints).</li>
        <li><strong>AI layer</strong> converts issues into structured explanations and fix suggestions (BYOK).</li>
        <li><strong>User-facing report</strong> is generated (e.g., email/notification) using the structured output.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <p class="meta">
        Note: the AI does not replace validation logic. It improves interpretability and reduces turnaround time for corrections.

      <h2>Backlog structure</h2>

        To demonstrate how this Proof of Concept would be structured in a real delivery context, below is an example of backlog decomposition into 
        Feature and Product Backlog Items (PBIs).
        The objective is to show how business needs are translated into implementable work packages with clear acceptance criteria.

          <strong>Feature goal</strong><br>
          In integration-heavy environments, multiple external partners interact with company APIs.
          Many of the values sent in API requests originate from operational user interfaces and are entered
          by end users during day-to-day activities (e.g., booking details, customer data, shipping instructions, customs declarations).
          <br><br>
          This feature aims to enhance the existing deterministic contract validation process by integrating
          an AI explanation layer capable of translating technical schema errors into structured,
          user-friendly messages and concrete correction suggestions.
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:12px;">
          <strong>Business value</strong><br>
          After submitting an API request, users typically receive a report (e.g., via email)
          confirming whether the call succeeded and listing any validation errors.
          In many real workflows, those errors are expressed in technical contract language,
          making them difficult to interpret and slowing down correction cycles.
          <br><br>
          By augmenting the validation process with structured AI explanations,
          this feature reduces friction between technical and operational teams,
          improves turnaround time for corrections,
          and increases overall integration reliability without replacing deterministic validation logic.
