      <h2>Context & Business Need</h2>
    
      <p>
        In integration-heavy environments, multiple external partners interact with the company through APIs.
        Many of the values sent in API requests originate from operational user interfaces and are entered by end users
        during day-to-day work (e.g., booking details, customer data, shipping instructions, customs declaration, ...).
      </p>
    
      <p>
        After submitting a request, users typically receive a report (for example via email) confirming whether the call
        succeeded and listing any validation errors. In many real workflows, those errors are expressed in highly technical
        terms (schema/contract language), which makes them hard to interpret and slows down correction cycles.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        This Proof of Concept aims to demonstrate that by integrating an LLM into the validation process,
        technical contract errors can be translated into user-friendly messages and concrete suggestions on how to fix the input,
        reducing friction for end users and improving the overall turnaround time for integrations.
      </p>

      <h2>Stakeholders & Users</h2>
    
      <p>
        The validation process impacts different actors across technical and operational domains:
      </p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Integration Partners:</strong> External systems calling company APIs. 
        When validation fails, they receive technical error messages that may not clearly indicate how to correct the request.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Operational End Users:</strong> Users entering data through front-end applications 
        (e.g., booking or customer details). API payloads often reflect data previously entered in a UI. 
        Technical validation errors returned via reports or emails can be difficult to interpret and act upon.</li>
    
        <li><strong>QA & Support Teams:</strong> Responsible for investigating validation failures and assisting in issue resolution. 
        Poorly interpretable errors increase analysis time and ticket volume.</li>
    
        <li><strong>Delivery & Product Stakeholders:</strong> Accountable for integration reliability and partner satisfaction. 
        Clear validation feedback directly impacts turnaround time and cross-team efficiency.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>High-Level Flow</h2>
    
      <p>
        The POC fits into a standard API validation workflow. The deterministic validation remains the source of truth
        (JSON Schema). The AI layer is used only to translate technical issues into user-friendly, actionable messages.
      </p>
    
      <ol>
        <li><strong>API request submitted</strong> by a partner system (values often originate from a user-facing UI).</li>
        <li><strong>Deterministic validation</strong> checks the payload against the JSON Schema contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Structured validation report</strong> is produced (technical issues, invalid values, expected constraints).</li>
        <li><strong>AI layer</strong> converts issues into structured explanations and fix suggestions (BYOK).</li>
        <li><strong>User-facing report</strong> is generated (e.g., email/notification) using the structured output.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <p class="meta">
        Note: the AI does not replace validation logic. It improves interpretability and reduces turnaround time for corrections.

      <h2>Backlog structure</h2>

        To demonstrate how this Proof of Concept would be structured in a real delivery context, below is an example of backlog decomposition into 
        Feature and Product Backlog Items (PBIs).
        The objective is to show how business needs are translated into implementable work packages with clear acceptance criteria.

          <br><br>
          This feature aims to enhance the existing deterministic contract validation process by integrating
          an AI explanation layer capable of translating technical schema errors into structured,
          user-friendly messages and concrete correction suggestions.

        <p style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:12px;">
          <strong>Business value</strong><br>
          After submitting an API request, users typically receive a report (e.g., via email)
          confirming whether the call succeeded and listing any validation errors.

          By augmenting the validation process with structured AI explanations,
          this feature reduces friction between technical and operational teams,
          improves turnaround time for corrections,
          and increases overall integration reliability without replacing deterministic validation logic.

            <strong>User Story</strong><br>
            As a delivery team member (BA, QA or developer),<br>
            I want incoming API payloads to be validated against an agreed JSON Schema contract,<br>
            So that contract violations are detected deterministically and consistently before reaching downstream systems.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            <strong>Description</strong><br>
            The system must validate JSON payloads using Draft 2020-12 JSON Schema specifications.
            Validation must be deterministic and act as the single source of truth.
            <br><br>
            When validation fails, the system must generate a normalized structured report including:
            <ul style="margin-top:6px;">
              <li>Technical error message</li>
              <li>Target path within the payload</li>
              <li>Validator type (e.g. type, minimum, enum, additionalProperties)</li>
              <li>Expected constraint</li>
              <li>Invalid value found in the payload (when available)</li>
            </ul>
            The output must be usable both for direct display and as structured input for the optional AI explanation layer.

            <strong>User Story</strong><br>
            As a QA or integration team member,<br>
            I want to enable a strict validation mode that fails when unexpected fields are present in the payload,<br>
            So that API contract enforcement is consistent and prevents unapproved data from being accepted.
          </p>
      
          <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
            <strong>Description</strong><br>
            The validator must support a <em>Strict mode</em> toggle.
            When Strict mode is enabled, the system must enforce <code>additionalProperties: false</code> at the root object
            (unless the schema already explicitly defines <code>additionalProperties</code>).
            When Strict mode is disabled, the schema must be used as provided (no implicit enforcement).
            <br><br>
            This capability is intended to reflect real-world integration constraints where payloads may include accidental
            extra fields originating from UI inputs, mapping layers, or partner implementations.

            With <strong>Strict mode ON</strong>, the same payload must fail.
